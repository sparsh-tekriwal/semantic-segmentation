# Semantic segmentation 

Training and deploying a Semantic Segmentation model using Amazon Sagemaker using the semantic segmentation algorithm from Sagemaker. In this project, we have trained and deployed a model that will be able to segment images of dogs and cats from the popular IIIT-Oxford Pets Dataset into 3 unique pixel values. That is, each pixel of an input image would be classified as either foreground (pet), background (not a pet), or unclassified (transition between foreground and background).
